## About the Repository

This repository is a centralized hub where I store and share the machine learning projects I've developed. I have tried to give each project, a uniqueness of its own, or at least tried to do something new with it to learn better. 
## Projects

Here's a list of the projects available in this repository:

1. [Car Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/atharv1707/MachineLearningProjects/blob/main/Car_price_prediction.ipynb)
   - Description: In this project, which is the first of many to come, we try to predict the values of the selling price of used cars, considering various other features as well like "kilometers-driven", "Fuel Type " etc.
